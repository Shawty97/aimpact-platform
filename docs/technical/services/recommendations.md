# Recommendation Engine

The Recommendation Engine provides intelligent suggestions for improving workflows, prompts, and agent configurations.

## Overview

The Recommendation Engine analyzes user workflows and agent performance to offer contextual suggestions for improvement, including prompt refinements, module additions, and configuration optimizations.

## Architecture

The engine uses a combination of heuristic rules and language model-based analysis to generate recommendations.

## Core Components

### AnalysisEngine

Analyzes workflows and agent configurations to identify improvement opportunities.

```python
class AnalysisEngine:
    def analyze_workflow(tenant_id, workflow_id)
    def analyze_prompt(tenant_id, prompt_id)
    def analyze_agent_config(tenant_id, agent_id)
```

### SuggestionGenerator

Generates specific, actionable recommendations based on analysis results.

```python
class SuggestionGenerator:
    def generate_workflow_suggestions(analysis_results)
    def generate_prompt_suggestions(analysis_results)
    def generate_module_suggestions(analysis_results)
    def prioritize_suggestions(suggestions, user_history)
```

### UserFeedbackProcessor

Tracks which recommendations were implemented and their impact.

```python
class UserFeedbackProcessor:
    def record_suggestion_action(tenant_id, user_id, suggestion_id, action, comments=None)
    def get_suggestion_impact(tenant_id, suggestion_ids)
```

## API Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/recommendations/workflows/{workflow_id}` | GET | Get workflow recommendations |
| `/api/recommendations/prompts/{prompt_id}` | GET | Get prompt recommendations |
| `/api/recommendations/agents/{agent_id}` | GET | Get agent recommendations |
| `/api/recommendations/{recommendation_id}/feedback` | POST | Record user feedback |
| `/api/recommendations/dashboard` | GET | Get recommendation summary |

## Configuration

The Recommendation Engine can be configured via environment variables:

```
MAX_RECOMMENDATIONS_PER_REQUEST=5
RECOMMENDATION_TTL=604800  # 7 days
RECOMMENDATION_REFRESH_INTERVAL=86400  # 1 day
MIN_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.7
```

## Integration Points

- Uses Memory Service for historical context
- Leverages Optimizer metrics for performance-based suggestions
- Integrates with the UI via the "Make Better" button and recommendation panel

## Suggestion Types

The engine provides several types of recommendations:

1. **Prompt Refinements**: Suggestions to improve prompt effectiveness
2. **Workflow Optimizations**: Changes to workflow structure for better outcomes
3. **Module Recommendations**: Suggested additional modules that could enhance functionality
4. **Configuration Adjustments**: Parameter tweaks to improve performance
5. **Error Prevention**: Suggestions to avoid common errors or edge cases
