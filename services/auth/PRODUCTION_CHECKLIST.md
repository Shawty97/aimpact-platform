- [ ] Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- [ ] Set up certificate renewal automation
- [ ] Configure TLS monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Test SSL/TLS configuration with tools like SSL Labs
- [ ] Ensure proper redirect from HTTP to HTTPS
- [ ] Configure CAA DNS records

## Post-deployment Tasks

### Health Checks
